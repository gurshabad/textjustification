textjustification
=================

This program will justify the given paragraph of text using two different algorithms.

The first one is a simple greedy algorithm, which can be found in the file greedy.py.

The second one is the better and more fascinating algorithm which uses dynamic programming and aims to minimise the total space at the end of each line.

This was done as part of a project by:

1. Gurshabad Grover
2. Tushar Gupta
3. Aneesh Dogra
4. Manav Batra
